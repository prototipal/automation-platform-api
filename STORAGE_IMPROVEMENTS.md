# Storage Service Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the StorageService to address DNS/fetch errors, 401/404 Replicate URL issues, and bucket/policy problems with comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- **DNS/Fetch Errors**: Better detection with specific error messages for connection issues
- **401/404 Errors**: Clear messaging about expired or invalid Replicate URLs
- **Network Timeouts**: Configurable retry with exponential backoff
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays between batch operations

### 2. URL Validation & Pre-checking
- Pre-flight URL validation with HEAD requests
- Caching of validation results (5-minute expiry)
- Detection of common issues: DNS, timeouts, auth errors
- Optional validation bypass for performance

### 3. Retry Mechanisms
- **Download Retry**: Exponential backoff for file downloads (max 3 attempts)
- **Upload Retry**: Automatic retry for Supabase uploads with duplicate handling
- **Configurable Settings**: Customizable retry count, delays, and backoff multipliers

### 4. Bucket & Policy Management
- **Health Checks**: Automatic bucket existence and accessibility verification
- **Auto-Creation**: Automatic bucket creation with proper policies if missing
- **Policy Validation**: Checks for proper read/write access
- **Connection Monitoring**: Regular health checks with caching

### 5. Batch Upload Optimization
- **Controlled Concurrency**: Max 3 concurrent uploads to prevent overwhelming
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging of batch upload progress
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing valid URLs even if some fail
- **Error Aggregation**: Collect and report all errors at the end

### 6. Monitoring & Diagnostics
- **Health Endpoint**: `/api/health` provides storage system status
- **Cache Management**: URL validation cache with configurable expiry
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing time tracking

## Configuration Updates

### Environment Variables
```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://rnjphepcnyquyuzhaxpy.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
SUPABASE_BUCKET_NAME=generations
SUPABASE_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=50
```

### Retry Configuration
```typescript
{
  maxRetries: 3,
  baseDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 10000,
  backoffMultiplier: 2
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
```
GET /api/health
```
Returns comprehensive storage system status including:
- Bucket existence and accessibility
- Connection health
- Configuration details
- Recent errors

### Upload Options
```typescript
interface FileUploadOptions {
  folder?: string;
  fileName?: string;
  userId?: string;
  sessionId?: number;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  retryCount?: number;
  skipUrlValidation?: boolean;
}
```

## Error Resolution

### Common Issues Fixed

1. **"fetch failed"** → Better network error handling with retries
2. **"Request failed with status code 401"** → Clear messaging about expired URLs
3. **"Request failed with status code 404"** → URL validation catches invalid URLs
4. **Bucket not found** → Automatic bucket creation with proper policies
5. **Rate limiting** → Controlled concurrency and delays between operations

### Troubleshooting

1. **Check Health**: Use `GET /api/health` to diagnose issues
2. **Review Logs**: Enhanced logging provides detailed error information
3. **Validate Config**: Ensure all Supabase environment variables are correct
4. **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms handle temporary network problems
5. **URL Problems**: Pre-validation catches invalid or expired URLs

## Migration Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: All existing code continues to work
- **Enhanced Methods**: `uploadFromUrl` and `uploadMultipleFromUrls` now have retry logic
- **New Features**: Health checks and diagnostics available immediately
- **Performance**: Better handling of batch uploads with controlled concurrency

## Testing

The enhanced service includes:
- Automatic health checks on module initialization
- URL validation caching for performance
- Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks
- Monitoring and diagnostics capabilities

Check the health endpoint after deployment to ensure everything is working correctly.
